## Overview: 
This application allows a user to select a state in a dropdown and view upcoming concerts. Once a state is chosen, 20 cards will appear that provide the following information about each concert: Artist, Venue, Date & Time, and a URL to buy tickets. Two buttons are at the bottom of each card: Save & View Map. When the View Map button is clicked, a Google Maps modal will appear that displays the venue address. When the save button is clicked, the concert will be saved into the browser’s local storage. The user can click the “Saved” button at the top right of the screen to view the concerts they saved. On this screen, the user can see all of the information about each concert, and the user also has the choice to delete a concert from their saved events.
